# OpenLMS - An Open-Source LMS Platform

Welcome to the official repository for the OpenLMS platform created at Queen's University. This repository is a comprehensive collection of our generic & extensible platform code as well as our official documentation that may assist in initializing, configuring, and modifying your own instance of the platform.

## Overview

The Open-Source LMS platform aims to make open education more accessible and usable to organizations. A blessing in the open education space is the ease of access to many great third-party courses hosted on unique online platforms. However, the curse and subsequent challenge lies in the lack of centralized platform which can be used to assign and track the completion of these courses.
