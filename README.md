# OpenLMS - An Open-Source LMS Platform

Welcome to the official repository for the OpenLMS platform created at Queen's University. This repository is a comprehensive collection of our generic & extensible platform code as well as our official documentation that may assist in initializing, configuring, and modifying your own instance of the platform.

## Overview

The Open-Source LMS platform aims to make open education more accessible and usable to organizations. A blessing in the open education space is the ease of access to many great third-party courses hosted on unique online platforms. However, the curse and subsequent challenge lies in the lack of centralized platform which can be used to assign and track the completion of these courses.

The platform is ready to use and will function effectively out of the box after creating an instance and configuring minor setup details. However, the code base is intentionally structured to be easily extensible to fit your organization's needs. 

## Creating an Instance

#### To streamline our development process and fit the needs of most organizations, we utilize these frameworks and services:

- Next.js is an open-source web meta framework using React to enable hybrid rendering of both the server and client side to significantly improve performance and SEO. and we use it because ...

- Vercel is a cloud platform allowing developers to easily deploy web applications enabling a seamless experience by taking care of deployment and scaling so developers can focus on their code. and we use it because ...

- Firebase is a collection of Google-powered back-end cloud computing services designed to simplify and enhance API creation, improvement, and growth. It offers key services like authentication, databases, and serverless functions, reducing the complexity and maintenance required for instance management. The OpenLMS core team specifically chose it due to it's reliability, simplisticity, and ease to scale and extend platform functionalities, making it ideal for minimizing technical overlead.

- Cloudflare is a global network designed to be secure, private, fast, and reliable. OpenLMS uses Cloudflare as a proxy between the Vercel production deployment and the user accessing the instance. This makes it ideal to migiate against potential DDoS attacks and simplify the instance's DNS services as well.

- Essentially, the tech stack choices were made with the ease of deployment and extensibility for future developers in mind!
